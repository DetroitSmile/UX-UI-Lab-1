      <p>Combines the flow of Vinyasa with the guided challenge of Slow Burn. 
        The pace of this class moves from some self-guided warm-ups into long-held
         postures that slow the body, focus the mind, and work toward a well-earned savasana. 
         If you are familiar with Short-Form Ashtanga, this class offers a similar pace.</p>

      <p>The fastest paced class, Vinyasa links breath with movement. A variation of Ashtanga Yoga, 
        Vinyasa classes sequence a variety of poses in a flowing movement that cultivates balance, 
        flexibility, strength, and endurance. Though this is a flow-based class, Citizen still maintains 
        the integrity of alignment by offering cues while students flow on their own. This ensures 
        everyone’s flow remains optimal and evolutionary. Catered towards a somewhat experienced yogi, 
        this class will challenge your breath and build physical endurance.</p>

      <p>Designed for people who are less familiar with the physical practice — never underestimate the 
        challenge of revisiting the basics. The class is completely guided, offers clear instruction, 
        and longer holding postures. It helps develop confidence and strength on your mat, and gives 
        you the courage to own your practice. It is the beginning of growing the connection between breath and movement.</p>

      <p>With an artfully designed transition from gentle movements to holding poses; this class allows 
        for students to cultivate a deep breath and body connection. Just as its name asserts, 
        you will find restoration in the rooted postures and relaxation in breath and body. It is slightly 
        more active than a traditional Yin Yoga class.</p>
